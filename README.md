## Getting help
If you need help with something, just create an issue or DM forteus19#8309 on discord.

## Contributing
If you have a feature a request or want to report a bug, then you can create an issue for that as well. Bug reports are very much needed, because zcb-gui has a lot of rough edges and finding bugs will greatly help with the project.

P.S. if you submit an issue don't expect me to reply very quickly because I'm usually very busy with something :P
